Description: Reproducible research compendium using 'renv', 'targets', 'Quarto',
    and best practices for quantitative ecology. This template provides a curated
    structure and tooling for end-to-end reproducible workflows. It is structured
    as an R package so it can be loaded with 'devtools' or 'pkgload' and used in
    a 'targets' pipeline.
